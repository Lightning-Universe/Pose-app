In the Image viewer tab we use `FiftyOne <https://voxel51.com/fiftyone/>`_ which is a powerful diagnostic tool that allows you to plot
predictions from each model you train directly on images, with corresponding ground truth labels.
The flexible user interface allows you to filter labels by keypoint, confidence range, etc., and
is useful for qualitative inspection of model performance.
