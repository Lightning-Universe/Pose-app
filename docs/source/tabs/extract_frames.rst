Choose number of frames to label per video - these frames will be automatically selected to
maximize the diversity of poses from each video.

You can also select the portion of the video to extract frames from.
If the beginning and/or end of your videos do not contain the animals or contain extra objects
(e.g. experimenter hands) we recommend excluding these portions.

Click "Extract frames" once the video upload is complete, and another progress bar will appear.

Once all frames have been extracted you will see "Proceed to the next tab to label frames" in green.
