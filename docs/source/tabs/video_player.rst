On the left panel, select a model from the drop-down menu.
Below that, you will see a drop-down menu listing all available labeled videos for that model.
Once you select a video it will appear in the player in the center.
The video is overlaid with a timestamp that contains the time and frame number.
You can also save the currently displayed video to your local computer by clicking on the three
vertical dots on the bottom right corner of the player.
