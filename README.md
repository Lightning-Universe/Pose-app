This repo contains a browser-based GUI that facilitate the deveopment of a pose estimation project.

The app allows you to

* label data (upload videos, extract frames, annotate keypoints)
* train and evaluate models
* run inference on new videos

Additionally, the app comes with an example dataset if you want to explore, without needing to
label your own data.

## Getting started

Please see the [Pose app documentation](https://pose-app.readthedocs.io/) for instructions on how to install and run the app.

We also provide [Lightning Pose documenation](https://lightning-pose.readthedocs.io/) for the core algorithm powering the app.
