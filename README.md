This repo contains a browser-based GUI that facilitates the deveopment of a pose estimation project.

The app allows you to:

* label data (upload videos, extract frames, annotate keypoints)
* train and evaluate models
* run inference on new videos

Additionally, the app comes with an example dataset if you want to explore, without needing to
label your own data.

As of June 2024, Lightning Pose is now [published in Nature Methods](https://rdcu.be/dLP3z)!

## Getting started

Please see the [Pose app documentation](https://pose-app.readthedocs.io/) for instructions on how to install and run the app.

We also provide [Lightning Pose documenation](https://lightning-pose.readthedocs.io/) for the core algorithm powering the app.
