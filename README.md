This repo contains browser-based GUIs that facilitate the deveopment of a pose estimation project.

We provide three different apps:
* `demo_app.py`: using provided example data, train and evaluate pose estimation models
* `labeling_app.py`: stand-alone labeling app where you can upload videos, extract frames, and annotate keypoints on extracted frames using LabelStudio
* `app.py`: full app that includes labeling, training, and evaluation

Preprint: [Lightning Pose: improved animal pose estimation via semi-supervised learning, Bayesian ensembling, and cloud-native open-source tools](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.28.538703v1)

## Getting started

Please see the [Pose app documentation](https://pose-app.readthedocs.io/) for instructions on how to install and run the app.

We also provide [Lightning Pose documenation](https://lightning-pose.readthedocs.io/) for the core algorithm powering the app.
