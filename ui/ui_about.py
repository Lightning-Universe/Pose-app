Convolutional Networks for pose tracking implemented in **Pytorch Lightning**, 
supporting massively accelerated training on *unlabeled* videos using **NVIDIA DALI**.

### A Single application with pre-integrated components
* Lightning Pose Configuration
* Train
* Train Diagnostics
* Image/Video Diagnostics Preparation
* Image/Video Diagnostics
* Image/Video Annotation

### Built with the coolest Deep Learning packages
* `pytorch-lightning` for multiple-GPU training and to minimize boilerplate code
* `nvidia-DALI` for accelerated GPU dataloading
* `Hydra` to orchestrate the config files and log experiments
* `kornia` for differntiable computer vision ops
* `torchtyping` for type and shape assertions of `torch` tensors
* `FiftyOne` for visualizing model predictions
* `Tensorboard` to visually diagnoze training performance

### Configuration
